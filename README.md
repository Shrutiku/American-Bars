[![N|Solid](https://americanbars.com/default/images/americanbars.png)](https://nodesource.com/products/nsolid)

American Bars Webapp is the clientâ€“server software application, in which the client runs in a web browser. In addition, American Bars API for native apps is stored in this repo and runs on the same server as AB Webapp. 

For convinience, AB Webapp refers to both the webapp and API.
